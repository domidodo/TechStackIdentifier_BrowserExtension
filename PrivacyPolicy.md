### Privacy Policy for the "TechStack Identifier" Browser Extension

#### 1. General Information
The "TechStack Identifier" browser extension is designed to help developers and users identify web environments (e.g., Development, Staging, Production) based on meta-tags. Protecting your privacy is a core principle of this extension. This policy explains how data is handled and what permissions are used.

#### 2. Collection and Processing of Personal Data
The "TechStack Identifier" extension is designed with a "privacy-first" approach.

- Local Storage: The extension stores your custom configuration (profiles, domain mappings, and exceptions) locally in your browser's storage.
- No Data Transmission: Your configuration data, the URLs you visit, and the meta-tag information detected by the extension are never transmitted to external servers or third parties.
- No Personal Data: The extension does not collect, track, or process any personally identifiable information (PII).

This data is **not** shared with third parties or transmitted to external servers.

#### 3. Use of Permissions
To provide its core functionality, the extension requires the following permissions:

- **Storage**: Used to save your environment profiles and domain mappings locally on your device.
- **ActiveTab**: Used to access the current tab's URL and title to check against your configuration when you interact with the extension.
- **Scripting**: Necessary to analyze the HTML head of the websites you visit to detect the specific `company:tech` meta-tag.
- **Host Permissions**: Required to allow the extension to check for meta-tags on the specific domains you have defined in your configuration.

#### 4. Use of Third-Party APIs
The "TechStack Identifier" extension does not use any third-party APIs. All logic and data matching are performed locally within your browser environment.

No personal data is shared with these APIs; only the necessary data required to retrieve the relevant information is transmitted.

#### 5. No Data Sharing with Third Parties
The extension does not share, sell, or distribute any data to third parties. All processing remains strictly local to your browser instance.

#### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update this privacy policy to reflect changes to the extension or new legal requirements. Please check this policy regularly for updates.
